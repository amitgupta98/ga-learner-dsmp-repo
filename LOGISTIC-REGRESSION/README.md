### Learnings from the project

 About the logistic regression model.That How to apply ths model when and why on which type of data also.The  data which have categorical output for that this model is build.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The logistic regression model is used for classification .In this first i"ve build the model and after we have to chack that how good our model is build for that we calculate the accuracy and othe score to check the model good or bad.This is all the process for building a good or bad model.
