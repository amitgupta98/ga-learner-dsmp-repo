### Project Overview

 A decision tree classifier is a tree in which internal nodes are labeled by features. Branches departing from them are labeled by tests on the weight that the feature has in the test object.


### Learnings from the project

 I've been learn how to apply decision tree classifier on data to build a perfect model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Mainly this project it did not take much time for solving.It depends on us how we solve the problem based on what we think and how we apply that on our model for the right prediction. I basically go through follows the task step by step and understand it clearly what type of approach i'm applying.


### Challenges faced

 There is not much bigger challenges come across solving the poject because if you follow the perfect guidence what you have learn then you will solve it easily.


### Additional pointers

 No.
