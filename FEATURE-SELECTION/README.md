### Project Overview

 The feature selection process is mainly used for selecting the best feature for h=the model and for to build the perfect model.Feature selection is an important concept in machine learning process.


### Learnings from the project

 I've been learn how to select a best feature for our model to build the perfect model for the right prediction.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Mainly this project it did not take much time for solving.It depends on us how we solve the problem based on what we think and how we apply that on our model for the right prediction. I basically go through follows the task step by step and understand it clearly what type of approach i'm applying.


### Challenges faced

 There is not much bigger challenges come across solving the poject because if you follow the perfect guidence what you have learn then you will solve it easily.


### Additional pointers
