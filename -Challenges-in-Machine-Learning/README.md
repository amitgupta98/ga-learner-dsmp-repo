### Project Overview

 this poject is based on what type of some challenges you will be faced that time of implementing and how to resolve this and how to tackle those problem.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project I get to know about imbalance datasets which is most imp in any ML model for implementing.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Basiclly we apply sampling method for generating the data point though some libraries in the process of solving that problem.It balance the datasets in both the manners for evaluating and getting better accuracy.


### Challenges faced

 The challenges we can faced is just how you can generalize a model which is imbalance the hyperparameter tuning is the most important things to keep in mind for solving this type of problem set.


### Additional pointers

 No I just want to add that learning new concept is good.
