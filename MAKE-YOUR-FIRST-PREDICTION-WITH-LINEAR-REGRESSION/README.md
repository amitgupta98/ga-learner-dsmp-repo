### Project Overview

 This project is based on linear rregression which is most important topic in data science field.The simple linear regerssion is based on simple target and one feature data which is continous.


### Learnings from the project

 By complitinh this project i"ve learn the conceptof linear regression and where we can apply this and how we can apply.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The linear regression is completely based on the data which you selected as the data is contionous and it will shows linear relationship with respect to target data then we can apply linear regression.The target data always in continous form  for a inear regression.


### Challenges faced

 The main challenges is that how to built the model is based on what type of data you have so first you have to do a many other operation which will give us a proper and perfect data for building a linear regression model on that data.


### Additional pointers

 Nothing
