### Project Overview

 This project is completely base on how to summarize the data. It will help us to determine the various aspect of taking a decision  based on the data what we have. this will reduce the error and the time and cost for the project also.


### Learnings from the project

 By this project I've learn the concept about how to summarize the data , it means how to evaluat different operaions on data like plotting scatter plot , finding coefficient and covariance .


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First of all I am a beginner in this field so I started with the simple tachniques for the better understanding what i'm doing with tha data. The data Itself provided by the tool so we ave to just solve the problem which is related to the data.And I'e llearn the so many conceps regarding the data and what we have to de before fittin model.Before predicting somethig the data needs to be as clear as we want our model, so this techniques will help us for generating a perfect data.


### Challenges faced

 The challenges i faced is not that much hard as the level we think so the call as a silly mistake which every programmer faced. By solving this project I've learn many more things and many more concepts which are need to know as a data scientist.


### Additional pointers
