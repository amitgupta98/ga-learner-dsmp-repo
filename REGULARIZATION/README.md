### Project Overview

 This project is based on gradient descent concept which is overcome of linear concept. this will apply on non linear data those are not linearly related.


### Learnings from the project

 I've laerned the gradient descent concept in machine learning.How to use this concept when to use and why to use.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The gradint descent method is best method for non linear data. But When I solve the project there is not that level complexity is derived.Because the data itself is perfect as the data we want for the building model.


### Challenges faced

 Actually when you clearly understand the concept about the method then there's no challenges you face regarding the building model but not sure there's no complexity you face.


### Additional pointers

 Nothing
